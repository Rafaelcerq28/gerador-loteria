# Random Number Generator for Lotteries

This is a Java-based REST API service developed with Spring Boot that generates random numbers for lottery games.

## Available Endpoints

- `/megasena`: Returns six random numbers for the Mega-Sena game.
- `/quina`: Returns five random numbers for the Quina game.
- `/lotofacil`: Returns fifteen random numbers for the Lotof√°cil game.


## How to Use

To use the API, make an HTTP GET request to the desired endpoint. For example:

GET /mega-sena


This will return a JSON object with the generated numbers:

```json
{
  "numbers": [5, 10, 22, 35, 42, 50]
}
```

## Running Locally

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
